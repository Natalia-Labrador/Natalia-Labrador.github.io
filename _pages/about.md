Welcome to my website!

I’m Natalia Andrea Labrador Bernate, Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Aix Marseille School of Economics (AMSE).

I’m currently analyzing weather shocks' impact on agricultural decision-making in farm households in developing countries. In particular, I'm exploiting the LSMS data for Malawi. 

I'm interested in Development Economics, Climate Change, and Gender.
